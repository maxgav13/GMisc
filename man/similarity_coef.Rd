\title{Similarity Coefficient}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of observations in rows and features (variables) in columns. Features must be numeric and positive.}

\item{samp.names}{A character vector with the names of the observations (samples)}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to use}
}
\value{
A matrix of similarity coefficients
}
\description{
Calculates the similarity coeficient between observations based on their features (columns). Coefficient ranges between 0 and 1, with values close to 1 indicating more similarity.
}
\examples{
dat = iris \%>\% group_by(Species) \%>\% sample_n(2)
similarity_coef(dat[-5])
