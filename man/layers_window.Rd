\title{Plots a layered model and summarizes the statistics for each layer}
\usage{
layers_window(x, breaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing the location variable (depth or distance) in the first column, and the value of interest in the second column}

\item{breaks}{A vector containg the breakpoints (from 'RI', 'Cohen d' or 'Mahalanobis D2')}
}
\value{
A ggplot and plotly objects showing the layered model, another showing the confidence intervals, and a summary table
}
\description{
Given a set of breakpoints, plots a layered model of one variable against distance, plots the confidence intervals for each layer, and gives a summary table.
}
\examples{
layers_window(DPM_data, breaks = c(3.8,8.9))
sub = subset(CPTu_data,select = c(depth,qc))
layers_window(sub, breaks = c(1.2,3.8,5.1))
