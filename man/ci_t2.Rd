\title{Confidence interval for difference of the mean between 2 samples}
\usage{
ci_t2(x1, s1, n1, x2, s2, n2, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Sample's 1 mean}

\item{s1}{Sample's 1 standard deviation}

\item{n1}{Sample size of sample 1}

\item{x2}{Sample's 2 mean}

\item{s2}{Sample's 2 standard deviation}

\item{n2}{Sample size of sample 2}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level to use for the confidence interval (Default is 0.95)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the difference of means, degrees of freedom, and lower and upper ends of the confidence interval
}
\description{
Calculates the confidence interval for the difference of the mean between 2 samples (t distribution).
