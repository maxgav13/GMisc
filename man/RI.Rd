\title{Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for layer boundary determination}
\usage{
RI(data, k = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{The window length for the number of data points to include in the calculation of RI. Always and even (par) number}

\item{x}{data A data frame containing the depth in the first column, and the value of interest in the second column}
}
\value{
ggplot and plotly objects showing the RI statistic and lines marking the critical values of 0.7 and 0.8, and suggested boundaries
}
\description{
Calculates the intraclass correlation coefficient (RI) for a perforation log, and shows the locations where this coefficient is higher than 0.7 and 0.8. The coefficient is used to find layer boundaries in a perforation log.
}
\details{
The example data given is intended to show the structure needed for input data. The user should follow this structure, which in general corresponds with a data frame with a sequence in the first column and the observed/measured values in the second column
